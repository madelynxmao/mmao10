K30 -- canvas based JS animation
2021-05-18t

This project utilizes the quadraticCurveTo feature of canvas to draw the parabolas in the McDonald's logo, and the circle feature to create the fading effect seen in ads.
We used cosine and sine to indicate the exact portion of the circle we wanted drawn.
