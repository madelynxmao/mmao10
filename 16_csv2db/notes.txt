-"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS" is pretty straightforward, used to prevent duplicates if you run the script more than once without deleting the db. 
-New thing called parameters, you put the variables you want to insert into the tuple and place it at the end of the insert command 
-The question marks in the values are placeholders for values that will be binded later, in this case they are binded in the params variable.
-csv.DictReader() reads in the csv file and stores its values in a dictionary
