K15: Sessions Greetings
2020-12-10

-To create a session, one must first import session from flask 
-Using sessions requires a secret key
-Logging out pops the username to remove it, and the index page checks to see if the username is in the session

Test Cases we checked:
-if any of the username or password field is empty or both empty
-if any of the username or password filed or both are incorrect
